Many applications in natural language processing rely on adapt-
ing one large-scale, pre-trained language model to multiple down-
stream applications. Such adaptation is usually done via fine-tuning,
which updates all the parameters of the pre-trained model. The ma-
jor downside of fine-tuning is that the new model contains as many
parameters as in the original model. As larger models are trained
every few months, this changes from a mere “inconvenience” for
GPT-2 (Radford et al., b) or RoBERTa large (Liu et al., 2019) to a
critical deployment challenge for GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) with
175 billion trainable parameters.1
Many sought to mitigate this by adapting only some parameters or
learning external modules for new tasks. This way, we only need
to store and load a small number of task-specific parameters in ad-
dition to the pre-trained model for each task, greatly boosting the
operational efficiency when deployed. However, existing techniques often introduce inference latency (Houlsby et al., 2019; Rebuffi et al., 2017) by extending model
depth or reduce the model’s usable sequence length (Li & Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Ham-
bardzumyan et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021) (Section 3). More importantly, these method often fail to
match the fine-tuning baselines, posing a trade-off between efficiency and model quality.
We take inspiration from Li et al. (2018a); Aghajanyan et al. (2020) which show that the learned
over-parametrized models in fact reside on a low intrinsic dimension. We hypothesize that the
change in weights during model adaptation also has a low “intrinsic rank”, leading to our proposed
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approach. LoRA allows us to train some dense layers in a neural
network indirectly by optimizing rank decomposition matrices of the dense layers’ change during
adaptation instead, while keeping the pre-trained weights frozen, as shown in Figure 1. Using GPT-3
175B as an example, we show that a very low rank (i.e., r in Figure 1 can be one or two) suffices even
when the full rank (i.e., d) is as high as 12,288, making LoRA both storage- and compute-efficient.
LoRA possesses several key advantages.
• A pre-trained model can be shared and used to build many small LoRA modules for dif-
ferent tasks. We can freeze the shared model and efficiently switch tasks by replacing the
matrices A and B in Figure 1, reducing the storage requirement and task-switching over-
head significantly.
• LoRA makes training more efficient and lowers the hardware barrier to entry by up to 3
times when using adaptive optimizers since we do not need to calculate the gradients or
maintain the optimizer states for most parameters. Instead, we only optimize the injected,
much smaller low-rank matrices.
• Our simple linear design allows us to merge the trainable matrices with the frozen weights
when deployed, introducing no inference latency compared to a fully fine-tuned model, by
construction.
• LoRA is orthogonal to many prior methods and can be combined with many of them, such
as prefix-tuning. We provide an example in Appendix E.
Terminologies and Conventions We make frequent references to the Transformer architecture
and use the conventional terminologies for its dimensions. We call the input and output di-
mension size of a Transformer layer dmodel. We use Wq , Wk, Wv , and Wo to refer to the
query/key/value/output projection matrices in the self-attention module. W or W0 refers to a pre-
trained weight matrix and ∆W its accumulated gradient update during adaptation. We use r to
denote the rank of a LoRA module. We follow the conventions set out by (Vaswani et al., 2017;
Brown et al., 2020) and use Adam (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019; Kingma & Ba, 2017) for model
optimization and use a Transformer MLP feedforward dimension df f n = 4 × dmodel.
